First_Step
Welcome to Gene Network Game! 
Put the promoter on the left side of the RBS (green oval) on the construct lane.
And put the gene between the RBS and the Terminator (Red Octagon).
Regulation
There are two types of regulation: activation and repression.
The Red promoter is activated by the protein connected by red arrow.  
The Blue promoter is repressed by the protein connected by blue arrow. 
FeedForward_1
FeedForward regulation is one of the most fundamental gene networks.
The network produces multiple proteins sequentially.

OR_Gate
You can put more than one promoters on the same construct.
It behaves like OR gate.

FeedForward_2
Pay attention to the time evolution of the concentration of "output" protein.
The production increases after the input rises, but goes back
 to the previous level at once.  It behaves like a pulse generator.
Oscillator_1
There are many oscillators in biological body
 such as clock gene, neural oscillation.
One simple way to make oscillator is using a Feedback loop.
Oscillator_2
Another type of an oscillator consisting 3 repressors.


AND_Gate
Look at the "output" protein.
It increses when both input proteins rise.
This network can be regarded as AND gate.
Toggle_Switch
A toggle switch has two states.
In this stage, one state is "A", "C"-high-state and the other is "B", "D"-high-state.
With the correct network, you can switch these states by two input proteins.
