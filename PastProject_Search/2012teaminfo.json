Our re-sourcing idea: the creation of an Omega-3 biosynthetic pathway in E. coli, using genes from a Cyanobacterium. Mass spectrometry analysis detected polyunsaturated fatty acids in cells expressing our desaturase enzymes; normal cells have none.Additionally, in seeking modern resource management solutions, specifically designed short peptide chains on the C-terminus of a GST fusion protein were expressed allowing the binding of precious and toxic metals. Such metals are often deposited in the environment.  Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy was used to demonstrate binding to our novel proteins.Finally, we modelled the impact our &lsquo;Fatty Acid Factory&rsquo; could have on total fish biomass before investigating the effect the iGEM Competition has in Science and elsewhere.",

The assay uses a dual plasmid system that selects for successfully transformed stem cells via neomycin and puromycin resistance along with fluorescent reporter genes regulated by atrial and ventricular promoters.

        "abstract": "Easily manipulated genetics make the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiaea versatile and widely used model eukaryote. To progress, researchers must often determine the mating type of haploid strains, which typically takes days. The goal of our project is to reduce that time to hours. So we designed a novel promoter harboring Ste12 and LexA binding sequences and placed it upstream of an ORF encoding a red fluorescent reporter fused to LexA binding and VP64 activator domains. Others have shown that this fusion protein induces its own expression from a LexA promoter. We propose that Ste12, activated in the pheromone response pathway, will bind the hybrid promoter and induce expression of the fusion protein, which will amplify and maintain its own expression. Therefore, when mating pheromone receptors on a haploid harboring this latch-type circuit are bound and activated, the cell will fluoresce and function as a rapid mating type detector.",

To help solve the problem, we design a gene circuit which can both detect and defend against the phages. We use the modified promoter pRM to sense the phage&rsquo;s infection and initiate the defence. The lysis gene which can make bacteria lyse is installed in our circuit. When it works, the phage won&rsquo;t be able to take advantage of its host to replicate any longer. To win more time for lysis to function well, we design antisense RNA to prevent the phage from turning into lytic life cycle. Thus, when the lysis protein kills the host, the phage is still at lysogenic life cycle or the newly assembled phages are still immature. By using the quorum sensing system, the bacteria around the host will prepare to defend in advance. Attribute to these parts, our bacteria survive.",

In this way, the sulfate component of the black crust is transformed into a gas, thereby degrading the offending substance without degrading the original material of the statue.

Although much effort has gone into the production of ethanol, other biofuels, such as butanol, are superior. Butanol has a higher energy content, is less volatile, and is safer to use than ethanol. To develop strains of bacteria that produce high levels of 1-butanol we have introduced the genes coding for a biochemical pathway from Clostridium acetobutylicum into a mutant E. coli strain that produces a high level of NADH. The combination of these chemical pathways is predicted to increase the level of butanol production. Our second project, the Bacterial Etch-a-Sketch, features a complex network of gene expression and repression that enables a lawn of bacteria to respond to 470nm light.

Upon cooking, the nutrient-binding domain denatures and releases the nutrients into the cooked rice.

This promoter, identified by microarray analysis, is significantly up-regulated in the presence of volatiles from spoiled meat. The activity of the promoter regulates the expression of the pigment reporter and will be visible to the naked eye. For safe usage of the system, spores of our engineered strain are placed into one half of a semi-permeable capsule, the second containing a calibrated amount of nutrients. Breaking the barrier between the two compartments allows germination and growth, thereby activating the spoiling meat sensor.",

By promoting the synthesis ofE.coliflagella genes and flagella activity under various conditions, such as salt concentration, nitrate concentration, pH and temperature, we can measure changes in flagella rotation and frequency.  This frequency can be translated into an audible range, which indicates the bacteria&rsquo;s distress and providing the researcher with a bacterial response to controlled growth conditions.
