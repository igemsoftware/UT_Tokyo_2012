Our goal is to introduce a 'bio-safety net' that will be applicable to virtually all genetically engineered bacteria as a vital termination step after their tasks have finished. We have made this possible by introducing a 'suicide' mechanism, that will be triggered under specific conditions. By combining different promoters, the system can respond to changes in  environmental factors and control expression specific to chosen factors. Such mechanism can be easily assembled and incorporated to bacteria through the use of biobricks.", "id": "366"}, "Warsaw": {"school": "University of Warsaw Faculty of Biology Miecznikowa 1 02-096 Warsaw, Poland www.biol.uw.edu.pl", "description": "University of Warsaw Team", "title": "An universal platform for protein delivery to the mammalian cells", "track": "Foundational Advance", "abstract": "Our project consists of two parts: BactoDHL and RBS Measurement. BactoDHL is a universal platform for protein and DNA delivery to the mammalian cells. It's based on E. coli strain expressing invasion determinants: invasin from Yersinia pestis and listeriolysin (LLO) from Listeria monocytogenes. Invasin causes uptake of the bacterium into the mammalian cell by induction of endocytosis. Bacterial cells are lysed in the endosome and then LLO is released. LLO is a pore-forming toxin which causes endosomal membrane disruption and release of the payload (either protein or DNA) into cytoplasm of the mammalian cell. In order to fine-tune expression of genes used in our project we conducted measurement of various RBS parts included in 2010 spring distribution both from Community and Anderson's collections. We used standard measurement kit composed of promoter BBa_J23100 and GFP+terminator part BBa_I130401. We performed both relative and absolute RBS strength measurement.", "id": "299"}}
