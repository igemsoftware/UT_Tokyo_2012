Protegrin-1\u2019s secondary structure is a beta -sheet conformation including a b-hairpin turn, which allows it to imbed itself into the phospholipid bilayer and disrupt bacterial cell walls by creating pores within the membrane.The antimicrobial activity of protegrin-1, including the action of pore formation, provides us with a wealth of potential applications for this kill switch, including drug delivery, conjugation both in vivo and in vitro, and its use as a basic biosafety tool.",

Gnome surfer promotes collaborative research by allowing users to browse genes, Parts, and other DNA along with their associated literature on a table-top surface. Using Optimus Primer, primers can be designed for the selected Parts. Trumpet generates permutable constructs from these Parts by interleaving invertase sites among them. To assemble these permutable constructs, we present a Protocol Automation Stack comprising a high-level programming language called Puppeteer, executable on a robot. For improving manual protocol execution, we are developing an Electronic Lab Notebook that helps capture data, and schedule resources and lab activities. Our unique tools offer an end-to-end workflow that is collaborative, includes wetlab automation and organization, and provides algorithms for designing configurable constructs.\"",

Additionally, we engineered E. Coli with the mechanism for light-induced apoptosis to easily lyse cultures producing the necessary enzymes.

Firedamp is a flammable gas found in coal mines and it mainly contains methane. Beside its explosive property, methane is also the main contributor to global warming. However, recent mechanisms in mines release the methane that is collected into air. By offers of Synthetic biology, we aimed to design a device which will work on E.coli that provides solutions for side effects of methane. Device that we are planning to construct involves the genes of bacteria (Methylococcus capsulatus) and insect (Drosophilia melanogaster) Our compact system in E.coli is fabricated as sensation of methane, the conversion of methane to methanol and then entrapment of methanol to handle for biofuel and death of bacteria at 42 C by kill switch mechanism.\"",

These bacteria could be used in lakes to make the ice stronger, for the creation of fluorescent ice on ski-slopes or for trendy cocktails with glowing ice cubes in it. Also, it would decrease ice-melting of glaciers, thereby effectively slowing down global warming.The second function of E.D. Frosti is the anti-freeze function by the production of Anti Freeze Proteins (AFP). These bacteria could then be used as anti-freeze biofilms on roads, which would help the roads become ice and snow free in winters. Also other applications which require ice melting could benefit from our bacterium.\"",

The system consists of two types of genetically modified E. coli: the random signal generating E. coli ('Brush E. coli') and the color generating E. coli ('Paint E. coli'). Brush E. coli possesses genes (lasI, luxI, rhlI, and cinI) in its gDNA that produce quorum molecules. On the other hand, by modified Cre-loxP mechanism, gDNA is randomly set to secrete only one of the four types of quorum molecules. Paint E.coli possesses plasmids that express one of four colors (red, cyan, yellow, and green) by producing fluorescent proteins in response to the type of quorum it receives from Brush E.coli. As Paint E.coli expresses corresponding fluorescence in response, it also produces quorum molecule that is identical to the inducer to start propagation. Ultimately, using this system, the 'random' contribution of cells will create art on an LB plate.",

Its growth rate decreases drastically at lower temperatures and growth completely halts below 7C.The aim of our project is to increase the cold tolerance of E. coli by expressing and combining several chaperone proteins that are normally found in psychrophillic bacteria. Chaperone proteins are essential in maintaining correct protein folding following changes in temperature. Therefore, expressing these proteins will likely enable enhanced growth rates at temperatures below 37C and shift the minimal growth temperature down from 7C, possibly even allowing growth near 0C.Our project is fundamental in its nature, but any application outside the labs, from biofuel production to bio-sensors, will benefit from the ability of icE.coli to grow at low temperatures, since this will relieve the burden and costs of maintaining the temperature constant at 37C. Moreover, we envision a temperature-based selection as an alternative to antibiotics-based selection.",

Oximes are toxic to fungus, as they inhibit the ability of the mitochondrial peroxidases to breakdown potentially harmful hydrogen peroxides. The oximes are produced from a variety of amino acids. As a proof of concept we aim at generating bacteria or CyperMen able to combat fungus on their own turf. The main goal is however to standardize different plant CYP79s and deliver them as BioBricks to iGEM.\"",

Here we use a synthetic biology approach to imitate heterochromatin in E.coli to achieve gene silencing. Specifically, fusion proteins comprising tetR and different parts of HNS (histone-like nucleoid structuring protein) were synthesized, they are expected to bind DNA specifically and carry out polymerization among the fusion HNS and the native HNS to create a densely packed DNA form, which may block the transcription. We produced constructs with tetO sites upstream or downstream of lac promoter and EGFP gene. Then we used standard constitutive promoters with different activity to drive our fusion proteins to find the optimum expression level. Moreover, tetR, HNS and fusion proteins were purified and gel shift assay was utilized to detect the interaction between those proteins with DNA. This study presents a novel approach to introduce a mimic heterochromatin-like structure into prokaryotes to achieve inducible gene silencing. \"",

Because the beginning of the protein influences the mRNA fold. We came up with the idea of RBS parts fused with short 'protein beginnings' -  expression adapters. Using genetic algorithm we designed expression adapters that would provide standardized protein expression or increase expression of your favorite protein.
